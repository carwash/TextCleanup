TextCleanup is developed to clean HTML from a .html file and output raw text without HTML tags into a .txt file. 

Sample file of AliceInWonderland.html included.
(Entire text of Aliceâ€™s Adventures in Wonderland via http://www.gutenberg.org/files/11/11-h/11-h.htm) 

Put this script in the same directory of the file you would like to scrub and run the command 

perl HTMLToCleanTxt.pl

in Terminal to create raw text files to work with.

Full instructions for working with this script in Perl: http://ow.ly/Vf09Etwi
